\section*{Acknowledgments}
I thank Dr. Larry Wilen, my thesis advisor and mentor, for his guidance and support over the past four years. I co-invented the pressure sensing mat together with him, and he taught me many things during this project, including how to sail.

I thank Alexander Wei for writing the hardware research paper that I reference, and for building the many pressure sensing mats used in this study. I thank Professor Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio for her support on this thesis. Her lab's papers on capacitive measurements were essential reading when I first started working with these sensors. I thank Professor Kyle Jensen for encouraging me to learn how to code, which led to this full writeup. I thank Eric Wang for always being willing to chat with me about code and the latest thoughts.

I thank Matthew Riley and Paul Douglass for data collection, testing, and building together. I thank the friends and colleagues I had the chance to work with on this project over my summers: Eunice Han, Justin Pan, Diana Cao, Matt Sahagun, Skylar Wang. I have learned a lot from you all. I thank Dean Vince for teaching the class where this project was initially conceived, and Abby Quinn for voicing the need for pressure data collection in athletics. I thank Jorge Torres for his mentorship throughout. I thank Yale Athletics, Yale Engineering, and Tsai City for their support. Finally, I thank all participants who provided data for this study.
