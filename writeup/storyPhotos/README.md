# Story Photos

Place your photos here for slide 11 of the presentation.

**File names to use:**
- `photo1.jpg` (top left)
- `photo2.jpg` (bottom left)
- `photo3.jpg` (top right)
- `photo4.jpg` (bottom right)

**Supported formats:** JPG, PNG, PDF

**Note:** If you only have 3 photos, you can:
1. Use 3 of the 4 slots and leave one empty (comment out that line in presentation.tex)
2. Or duplicate one photo for the 4th slot

The images will be automatically resized to fit the slide layout.
